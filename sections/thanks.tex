\chapter*{Thanks}

\subsection*{Family}
My foremost thanks go to Mum and Dad for their enormous financial and emotional support.
Thanks also to my sisters Lisa and Susan for their encouragement, albeit mostly through some form of reverse psychology.
My brother from another mother, John deserves much credit for helping to keep me sane, fed and caffeinated during the daytime.
Also there's an understanding, wise and stump-wagging family bundle of joy named Shep whose endless barking and occasional stray dog hair on my otherwise ho-hum laptop screen brightened many days.

\subsection*{Ted}
As is true of all supervisors, without Ted's help this thesis would never have come to fruition.
Not so true of all supervisors is that Ted has always been patient, insightful and helpful.
I greatly appreciate your assistance Ted, in getting me so much closer to my future goals.

\subsection*{The School}
Thanks to my fellow Ph.D. students in the School of Mathematics, Statistics and Applied Mathematics for the coffee breaks and the laughs.
I'm grateful to many of the lecturers for listening and offering ideas, especially Jerome and Claas.
Thanks also to Niall for helping a poor defenseless outsider through his undergraduate years.

\subsection*{Friends and More Family}
I'm so grateful to Granny K. and Paula for always asking how I was getting on.
Finally, thanks to all my friends, lads and ladies---there are too many to list here.
